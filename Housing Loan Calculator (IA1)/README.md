# Individual Assignment 1: A Housing Loan Calculator
The following file is a simple housing loan calculator written in Python. 

The main function of this program is to calculate new housing loans where the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) and the base lending rate were taken into consideration together with the loan principal, the applicant's income and commitments to calculate the viability of the loan according to the applicant's Debt Service Ratio (DSR).

These loan calculations are then saved using the Pickle module in order to access them even when the program is closed and reopened. 

Finally, the third function of this program is for the user to edit the DSR limit to their preference.
